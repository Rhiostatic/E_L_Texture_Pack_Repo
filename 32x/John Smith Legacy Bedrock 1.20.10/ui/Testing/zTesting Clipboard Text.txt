
These are the two images used:-

textures/ui/experiencebarempty.png
textures/ui/experiencebarfull.png

There are five files that make use of these images, one of them is for the loading screen.

ui/achievement_screen.json
ui/file_upload_screen.json
ui/hud_screen.json
ui/popup_dialog.json
ui/store_common.json

Right, I've tracked it down to the achievement screen file (which makes very little sense).

ui/achievement_screen.json

Anyway this is linked to from another file:-

ui/progress_screen.json

Now I've tracked it down to the "fancy_progress_loading_bars" but I'm not sure what to change.

Here's the vanilla file for you to look at if you can help (section starting a line 580-616 and 1109-1130).
